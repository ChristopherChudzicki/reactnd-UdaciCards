# UdaciCards

My final project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program: a mobile flashcard study app for iOS & Android built with react-native using Redux for state management.

## To Run

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
2. `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3. `npm start` (or `yarn start`)
4. Follow directions on the command line to open app on a simular or physical device.

Note: This project was primarily tested in the iOS emulator and an iPhone 8 Plus. (Notifications will not work in the iOS emulator.) The app also seems to work on Android emulators and devices, but some transitions are very slow.
